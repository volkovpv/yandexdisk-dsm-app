# The .spk file name embeds the package version (e.g. YandexDisk-ARM-1.1.0.spk)
# so GitHub Release assets are self-describing and revisions never silently overwrite.
# The rclone binary and the .spk are NOT committed (released as GitHub assets); this
# script reconstructs rclone from the official release by checksum, so a fresh clone
# can build with only network access on first run (the zip is then cached locally).
#
# Functional sync against a live Yandex account is validated ONLY on a real NAS
# (test-on-nas-*.sh). Off-device checks run here and are ALL mandatory — a check
# that silently skips when a tool is missing gives a machine-dependent verdict:
# CRLF + shell syntax + shellcheck + checkbashisms, JSON control files,
# version drift across docs, rclone log-marker contract, ELF arch of rclone,
# exec bits, reproducible package re-assembly.
# Behavioural (hermetic) tests live in test/run-hermetic.sh and run separately.
